Description: Automatic, semi-automatic, and manual functions for
    generating color maps from images. The idea is to simplify
    the colors of an image according to a metric that is useful for
    the user, using deterministic methods whenever possible.
    Many images will be clustered well using the out-of-the-box
    functions, but the package also includes a toolbox of functions
    for making manual adjustments (layer merging/isolation, blurring,
    fitting to provided color clusters or those from another image, etc).
    Also includes export methods for other color/pattern analysis packages
    (pavo, patternize, colordistance).
